## Code Explanation

The JavaScript code provided implements the functionality of the todo list application. Here's a brief explanation of the key functions and variables:

- `todos`: An array that stores the todo objects retrieved from the localStorage. If there are no todos in the localStorage, it initializes an empty array.
- `editIndex`: A variable that keeps track of the index of the todo being edited. It is initially set to -1.
- `saveTodos()`: A function that saves the todos array to the localStorage.
- `renderTodos()`: A function that renders the todos in the todo list. It creates the necessary HTML elements for each todo and appends them to the todo list container.
- `addTodo()`: A function that adds a new todo to the todos array. It retrieves the todo text from the input field, creates a new todo object, and adds it to the array. If the editIndex is not -1, it updates the existing todo at that index instead of adding a new one.
- `toggleTodoCompleted(index)`: A function that toggles the completed status of a todo at the specified index in the todos array.
- `deleteTodo(index)`: A function that deletes a todo at the specified index from the todos array.
- `editTodo(index)`: A function that allows editing a todo at the specified index. It retrieves the todo text from the todos array and populates the input field with it. It also updates the editIndex and the visibility of the add and update buttons.
- `searchTodo()`: A function that performs a search for todos based on the search query entered in the search input field. It filters the todos array based on the todo text and renders the search results.
- `renderSearchResults(results)`: A function that renders the search results in the todo list container. It creates the necessary HTML elements for each search result and appends them to the container. If no search results are found, it displays a "NOT FOUND" message.
